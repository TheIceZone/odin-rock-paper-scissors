# odin-rock-paper-scissors
This is the first project in The Odin Project that involes using Javascript. Using the console and only js, I coded a rock paper scissors game where the website prompts the user for a choice, compares the users choice to the computers generated choice, displays who won and who picked what, and displays the current score. This goes on for 5 rounds, where the console declares who won based on who had the higher score. While there is no visual elements to the website yet, this proved that I understand the basics of js and am ready to start combining js with html and css. I defiently need to start commiting more though, as my commits where pretty few and far between, with the first one having the project almost completed.

Update: After learning about DOM integration, a new version of the rps game was coded that uses buttons to let the user select rock paper or scissors, and displays the winner and score in text on the page instead of in the console. This removes the need for the user to type and use the console to learn who won. It also changed the game from a best of 5 rounds to a first to 5 style game, meaning no draws will occur.
