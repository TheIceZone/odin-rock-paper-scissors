# odin-rock-paper-scissors
This is the first project in The Odin Project that involes using Javascript. Using the console and only js, I coded a rock paper scissors game where the website prompts the user for a choice, compares the users choice to the computers generated choice, displays who won and who picked what, and displays the current score. This goes on for 5 rounds, where the console declares who won based on who had the higher score. While there is no visual elements to the website yet, this proved that I understand the basics of js and am ready to start combining js with html and css. I defiently need to start commiting more though, as my commits where pretty few and far between, with the first one having the project almost completed.
